# Frontend Technical Assessment
Welcome to FinSphera Frontend Technical Assessment. This is a challenge to evaluate your skills as a frontend developer. The challenge is divided in two parts, the development of a small application and the definition of a hypothetical architecture for a bigger one. The assessment is structured to give you the freedom to show your skills and creativity as a developer ðŸ§ .

## Part 1. Develop a small application.
 As a part of the challenge, you will be required to build some of the followings projects. ONLY ONE OF THEM.
1. A movie landing page that shows a list of movies and their details. You can use the movie database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to get the data or any other API of your preference.
Example:

2. A GitHub clone page that shows a list of repositories and their details. Consume from the GitHub API.
Example:

The project should be built using React or Next.js and will have to follow the following aspects:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Built from scratch: You have the opportunity to create the repository from scratch or using a template, but the code should be yours. As a personal recommendation, I suggest using Vite.
3. Feel free to use any library or framework that you consider necessary to complete the project as well the CSS technology of your preference.
4. Implement the features that you consider necessary for the UI/UX.
5. Deploy the project on the platform of your choice, and finally give us the link to your public repository and of the deployed project.

> The assestment will have a limited time to be completed. I suggest to organize to complete the aspects to be evaluated over seek the perfect project. You can document the points that you would have added if you had more time.

### Aspects to be evaluated
* The correct handling of git workflow, good organization of the commits and the branches.
* The quality of the code, following the best practices and the patterns of the language.
* The quality of the user interface, the user experience and the responsiveness of the application it's a crucial aspect.
* Documentation of the project. You have the opportunity to show here how organized you are. Don't miss the opportunity ðŸ˜‰.
* How you handle the API requests and the data that you get from them.
* The management of the data and the state of the application. You can use the tool that feels more comfortable, whatever it is Context API, Redux, Recoil, etc. But show understanding of their concepts.
* A small demonstration of testing. It's not necessary to test all the components, but at least show how you would test a component or a hook.
* If you feel short of time, please document the steps that you would have taken to complete the project or what you would have added.
* Creativity. You have the freedom to add any feature, pattern, library, or technique that you feel shows your skills as a developer.
* Extra points if you implement a simple auth formulary, doesn't matter if it's with dummy data, but implement good practices of forms validation.
* Typescript is a must.

## Part 2. Architecture
* As the second part, you have to write in a markdown file into the root of the project, how you will handle a hypothetical situation where you have to scale the application to a bigger one. For example. How you will handle the state, components, routing system or even how it will be integrated with the backend or cloud services.
